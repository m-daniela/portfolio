                <p>My name is Daniela and I am a web developer based in Romania.</p>
                <p>Since 2021, I have been continuously developing my programming skills and exploring various libraries and frameworks, with my main focus being on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        full stack applications, using <span>React, Redux, SCSS, express.js, Flask, FastAPI</span> and both sql and nosql databases

                <p><strong>Personal Issue Tracker</strong> is a customizable Kanban-style board for issue tracking, created with <span>Next.js 13, Redux Toolkit, Firebase Firestore, dnd kit, SASS</span>.</p>
                <p>The user can add projects and create new tasks, organize them by categories, track their progress, document the issues.</p>
                <p>It also has a filtering feature, so the tasks can be searched by label and by title.</p>

                <p><strong>Zefon</strong> is an instant messaging application with end-to-end encryption and support for attachments and group chats.</p>
                <p>In order to create it, I have used <span>React, Redux Toolkit, express.js, Firebase Firestore, Firebase Authentication, socket.io, SASS</span>. The end-to-end encryption logic was built using the <span>VirgilSecurity</span> framework.</p>
                <p>The user first registers with an email, then they can create private or group chats, with or without encryption. Each chat has a "3rd party view" toggle, so the user can see what data is available to the provider.</p>
                <p>I have created this application while I was completing my Bachelor's degree, but I have started working on a new, updated version, with <span>Typescript</span>.</p>

                <p><strong>The Library</strong> is a role-based library app with <span>JWT authentication</span>, created with <span>FastAPI, React, postgresql, SQLAlchemy</span> and tested with <span>pytest</span>.</p>
                <p>The users can be normal users, who can browse, filter, borrow, return books, check and change their profile information, admins, who have acces to other functionalities, such as accepting new users and generating reports, and contact users, who only have access to the chat and all conversations.</p>
                <p>Normal users and admins have a single chat window and can talk to the contact users. This functionality was implemented using <span>socket.io</span>.</p>
                <p>It also has a mailing feature, implemented using <span>Celery</span>, which automatically sends emails to the users on registration, after the borrowing period has expired, or on book checkout.</p>
                <p>I have implemented some functionalities using <span>Flask</span>.</p>

                <p>The article sanitization process is done on the backend, then the information is sent to the frontend to be displayed.</p>

                <p><strong>Breadit</strong> is an online forum-like platform for food related discussion, sharing recipes and tips, latest bakes etc. The format is similar Reddit, but all posts are anonymous.</p>
                <p>I have created it using <span>React, Redux Toolkit, express.js, MySQL, SASS</span>. It also has an integrated Rich Text Editor implemented using <span>react-quill</span> and a post search feature.</p>

                <p><strong>Job Aggregator</strong> is a web scraper which collects the jobs from various job boards and displayes them in a clear and simplified manner.</p>
                <p>The user can input a list of urls that will be scraped or the HTML itself. After these are parsed, the user has access to all available jobs and advanced filters based on the current data.</p>
                <p>The filtering system includes: common searches, filter by date, application type, company, location, general location (country, continent, economic zone), job type, and the sorting system: sort alphabetically, by date.</p>
                <p>Since the location and company options might get large, these sections have an integrated search bar, with debounce, to narrow the results.</p>
                <p>I have created it using <span>React, Tailwind CSS, Flask, SQLAlchemy, sqlite3, pyautogui, beautifulsoup4, pytest</span>.</p>
